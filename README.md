This was an HTML, CSS based project where I had to implement an instructed web page with functioning anchors in navigation bar that allow us to navigate between sections smoothly, I also implemented a responsive screen for a laptop with (over 1000px) and a mobile with (under 768px) I included my github link at the bottom as well and used flexbox for almost the entire structure. sematic tags were also used to provide a better structure for the work flow. all part of the checklish were done as instructed.
